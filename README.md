# NeoGeoMiniRomAdder
 A tool to aid adding and editing roms to the NeoGeoMini (Hylostick fw) 

To use, open the exe and find the NGMH folder you wish to work on. Select an emulator from the top grid, and a rom from the bottom grid, and edit.

Please note that only non-fba games are supported right now - trying to edit an fba one will probably break that game.
